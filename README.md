This is a way of allowing your users and your server to be just a little bit more secure. This is guided toward those who are completely fine with browsing a website inside of a terminal via ssh.

The box the users will be connecting to will be one with either the webserver on the ssh machine (127.0.0.1) or have the webserver be connectable via local area network (LAN)

Starting off with the machine the users will connect to, setup sshd-server on the machine the users will connect to, nextly, install apache2, then lynx, a small terminal only webbrowser, as well as lshell, a lightweight shell for restricting users when in shell. Configure ssh how you want, as well as the apache server as desired. I will not be going over how to install or configure these. Nextly open up .bashrc with (nano .bashrc) add the following code to the bottom of .bashrc: lshell && lynx 127.0.0.1 && exit This will make the user once sshed into the machine be automatically connected to the local apache2 machine, and when the user wants to leave, they exit lynx and it kicks the user out of the ssh-server. If the user somehow gets out of lynx, and it does not exit, lshell is the backup for if the user can still be inside the system after the lynx job dies. Lshell can be configured so that the user cannot both exit lshell into the normal terminal on the server and not have any commands that they can execute if they leave lynx.
